Profile of Dragit
For detailed Python and C code and general user manual, refer to LEARN page.
Instead of coding the Sensor Kit directly in Python, you can also do it in a graphical/visual
programming software - Dragit, developed based on Snap! (check http://snap.berkeley.edu/ for
more). What's good about Dragit is that, the programming process is visible with graphics. So you
can just drag and drop the blocks (unit in the software) to make the code in each lesson, no need of
the knowledge of any programming languages or syntaxes.
So now, let's explore the wonderful programming world in sensors, with Dragit!
Install Dragit
Before any operations, you need to log into the Raspberry Pi remotely first. Here's how:
1． Get the IP address of the Raspberry Pi:
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ip-address.md
2． Log in with the IP address, by ssh or VNC:
For ssh: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/README.md
For VNC: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/vnc/README.md
Now you're on the RPi already. Open a terminal for command lines. Let's see what next.
1. Type in the command below:
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/sunfounder/Raspberry/dragit_installer.py
2. After download is done, type in the command to run:
2 www.sunfounder.com
sudo python dragit_installer.py
3. Then you can see what to install. Switch to the one you'd like to install by the arrow key, and
check the box by Space bar.
To apply the sensor kit with Dragit, you only need to install the top one, Install Dragit.
Then the program will finish the installation automatically. Just wait for a while and DO NOT
disconnect the network.
If the prompt above appears, it means the installation is done.
Then reboot the Raspberry Pi:
sudo reboot
On your computer/tablet, open a web browser (Chrome/Firefox/Safari recommended), enter the IP
address of the Raspberry Pi and then 8000:
Example: 192.168.0.177:8000

Lesson 1 Dual-Color LED
WHAT IS IT
Semiconductor light-emitting diode (LED) is a type of component which can turn electric energy into
light energy via PN junctions. A dual-color LED is capable of emitting two different colors of light,
typically red and green, rather than only one color.
WHAT WE NEED
- 1 * Raspberry Pi
- 1 * Breadboard
- 4 * Jumper wires
- 1 * Network cable (or USB wireless network adapter)
- 1 * Dual-color LED module
- 1 * 3-Pin anti-reverse cable
WHAT WE WANT TO DO
Connect pin R and G to GPIOs of Raspberry Pi, program the Raspberry Pi to change the color of the
LED to red or green.
HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO
Step 1: Build the circuit
T-Cobbler Dual-Color LED Module
GPIO17 R
GND GND
GPIO18 G
7 www.sunfounder.com
Step 2: Drag it
1．In the Palette, click the category.
2．Drag the block under the category to the scripting area.
3．Select the value for the block.
On the left is the channel to output. In the wiring previously, pin R of the Dual-Color LED Module
connects to GPIO17 of the Raspberry Pi, so here select 17 behind gpio to control the red (R) LED;
select 18 to control the green (G) one.
On the right is the value of output. Since GND of the module connects to GND of the RPi, when
you select HIGH here, the LED will light up; select LOW, it'll go out.
4．Click this block and you'll see the red LED of the Dual-Color LED Module lights up. 
8 www.sunfounder.com
Select LOW for output and click the block again. Yep, the LED goes out.
So in the same way, drag one more such block to the scripting area, select 18 for gpio, HIGH for
output, and then you can use it to control the G (green) LED. 
9 www.sunfounder.com
Lesson 2 RGB LED Module
WHAT IS IT
RGB LED modules can emit various colors of light. The three primary colors of red, green, and blue
can be mixed and compose all kinds of colors by brightness, so you can make an RGB LED emit
colorful light by controlling the circuit.
WHAT WE NEED
- 1 * Raspberry Pi
- 1 * Breadboard
- 4 * Jumper wires (Male to Male, 2 red and 2 black)
- 1 * Network cable (or USB wireless network adapter)
- 1 * RGB LED module
- 1 * 4-Pin anti-reverse cable
WHAT WE WANT TO DO
Here we input any value between 0 and 100 to the three pins of the RGB LED to make it display
different colors.
RGB LEDs can be categorized into common anode LED and common cathode LED. In this experiment,
we use a common cathode RGB LED.
HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO
Step 1: Build the circuit according to the following method
T-Cobbler RGB LED Module
5V VCC
GPIO17 R
GPIO18 G
GPIO27 B
10 www.sunfounder.com
Step 2: Drag it
1．In the Palette, click the category.
2．Drag the block
into the scripting area.
11 www.sunfounder.com
3．Set the parameters.
Based on the wiring before, R connects to pin 17, G
to pin 18 and B to pin 27; the RGB LED used here is a
common cathode one, so no need to change the
com. Then select a color to shine. Note: Since the
color of this palette works differently with the RGB
LED and PWM output of the RPi adds to the situation,
the color selection here is not that good in display by
the RGB. The colors in the orange box would be
much better in reality, so you're recommended to
select these as possible.
You will see the RGB LED light up, and display
different colors in turn.
12 www.sunfounder.com
Lesson 3 7-Color Auto-flash LED
WHAT IS IT
On the 7-Color Auto-flash LED module, the LED can automatically flash built-in colors after power on.
It can be used to make quite fascinating light effects.
WHAT WE NEED
- 1 * Raspberry Pi
- 1 * Breadboard
- 4 * Jumper wires (Male to Male, 2 red and 2 black)
- 1 * Network cable (or USB wireless network adapter)
- 1 * 7-color auto-flash LED module
- 1 * 3-Pin anti-reverse cable
WHAT WE WANT TO DO
When it is power on, the 7-color auto-flash LED will flash built-in colors.
HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO
Build the circuit
T-Cobbler Auto-flash LED Module
GND GND
5V0 VCC
13 www.sunfounder.com
Note: There are two “GND” pins on the module. You only need to connect one of them.
Now, you will see 7-color auto-flash LED flashing seven colors.
14 www.sunfounder.com
Lesson 4 Relay Module
WHAT IS IT
Relay is a device which is used to provide connection between two or more points or devices in
response to the input signal applied. It is suitable for driving high power electric equipment, such as
light bulbs, electric fans and air conditioning. You can use a relay to control high voltage with low
voltage by connecting it to Raspberry Pi.
WHAT WE NEED
- 1 * Raspberry Pi
- 1 * Breadboard
- 4 * Jumper wires (Male to Male, 2 red and 2 black)
- 1 * Network cable (or USB wireless network adapter)
- 1 * Relay module
- 1 * Dual-color LED module
- 2 * 3-Pin anti-reverse cable
WHAT WE WANT TO DO
Connect the base electrode of the transistor to BCM17. When we make BCM17 output high level
(3.3V) by programming, the transistor will conduct because of current saturation. The normally open
contact of the relay will be closed, while the normally closed contact of the relay will be broken; when
we make it output low level (0V), the transistor will be cut off, and the relay will recover to initial state.
HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO
Step 1: Build the circuit

G * Normal Close
15 www.sunfounder.com
Step 2: Drag it
1．In the Palette, click the category.
2．Drag the block into the scripting area.
3．Set the parameters for the block.
16 www.sunfounder.com
In the circuit connection before, pin SIG of the Relay Module connects to gpio17, so here select
gpio17 to control the module. As mentioned in Lesson 1, set the output value on the right side.
Based on the introduction of the relay previously, if HIGH is selected for output here, the red LED
of the Dual-color LED module will light up; if you select LOW, the green one will be turned on.
4．Click the block and you'll see the red LED of the Dual-Color LED Module light up.
Select LOW for output and try to click the block again. Yep, the green light brightens.
Now, you may hear the ticktock. That's the normally closed contact opened and the normally open
contact closed. You can attach a high voltage device you want to control, like a 220V bulb, to the
output port of the relay. Then the relay will act as an automatic switch.

Lesson 5 Laser Emitter Module
WHAT IS IT
Laser is widely used in medical treatment, military, and other fields due to its good directivity and
energy concentration.
WHAT WE NEED
- 1 * Raspberry Pi
- 1 * Breadboard
- 4 * Jumper wires (Male to Male, 2 red and 2 black)
- 1 * Network cable (or USB wireless network adapter)
- 1 * Laser Emitter module
- 1 * 2-Pin anti-reverse cable
WHAT WE WANT TO DO
In this lesson, let's use Dragit to control the interrupt of the Laser Emitter module to send Morse
code.
HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO
Step 1: Build the circuit
T-Cobbler Laser Emitter Module
5V0 VCC
GPIO17 SIG
18 www.sunfounder.com
Step 2: Drag it
1．In the Palette, click the category.
2．Drag into the scripting area.
3．Enter the parameters for the block.
In the circuit connection before, pin SIG of the Laser Emitter Module connects to gpio17, so here
select gpio17 to control the module. As mentioned before, set the output value on the right side.
Based on the introduction of the laser emitter above, if HIGH is selected for output here, the
module will be turned off; if you select LOW, the module will emit laser rays.
4．Click the block and you can control the interrupt of the Laser emitter Module.
5．Now we can imitate the Morse code with the interrupt of the laser emitter module.
But first here are some tips for using the Dragit: 
19 www.sunfounder.com

1) Combine blocks: Find and click the block under the category,
drag it under the gpio block. A white line will appear when they get close, drop the block and
they'll stick together and make a chunk block.
2) Duplicate a block: Right click on the chunk, select duplicate to copy this block. This function
makes repeating blocks much easier.
3) Self-define a block: Under the block , click at the bottom to selfcustom a block.
○1 Click the block
○2 Click Make a block
○3 Set the category of the
to-be-created block:
Modules
○4 Set the type: Command
○5 Name the block: Dit
○6 Click OK to confirm the
creation
Then the new block will appear on the window:
20 www.sunfounder.com
So drag the previously combined block into the Block Editor, under the Dit. Click OK. Now under the
Modules you can see the new Dit block. If you still want to change it, just right-click on it and select
edit, so you'll return to this window.
In the same way, make a block named Dah.
Set the steady lighting on as "-" and quick flashing for "·" in Morse code. Based on the figure above,
we can create and send a message by the on and off of the laser emitter module. For example, the
Morse for SOS is: ··· －－－ ···. Program the laser rays to show like that, to put it simple, 3 steady on,
3 flashing and again 3 steady on, so we get an SOS!
All you need to do is use the self-defined Dit (flashing) and Dah (steady light) blocks to make this
code.
21 www.sunfounder.com
Not difficult to see that the combined block gets more concise after being self-customed.
Now you can see the module send out Morse signals.
Note: Do NOT look directly at the laser head for your safety. It can cause great harm to your eyes. You
can point the laser beam to the table and see the light spot flashing on the table.

Lesson 10 Buzzer Module
WHAT IS IT
Buzzers can be categorized as active and passive ones. The difference between an active buzzer and
a passive buzzer is: An active buzzer has a built-in oscillating source, so it will make sounds when
electrified. But a passive buzzer does not have such source, so it will not beep if DC signals are used;
instead, you need to use square waves whose frequency is between 2K and 5K to drive it. The active
buzzer is often more expensive than the passive one because of multiple built-in oscillating circuits.
WHAT WE NEED
- 1 * Raspberry Pi
- 1 * Breadboard
- 4 * Jumper wires (Male to Male, 2 red and 2 black)
- 1 * Network cable (or USB wireless network adapter)
- 1 * Passive buzzer module
- 1 * Active buzzer module
- 1 * 3-Pin anti-reverse cable
WHAT WE WANT TO DO
1. Beep the active buzzer
2. Play some melody with the passive buzzer
HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO
Active Buzzer
Note: The active buzzer has built-in oscillating source, so it will beep as long as it is wired up, but it
can only beep with fixed frequency.
Step 1: Build the circuit
T-Cobbler Active Buzzer Module
GPIO17 SIG
5V0 VCC
GND GND
34 www.sunfounder.com
Step 2: Drag it
Using the active buzzer is just like applying the relay in Lesson 4, so simply steps will be given here.
For more, you can return to L4.
1．Drag from to the scripting area.
2．Select the values for the block.
3．Click the block and listen whether the buzzer beeps.
4．Change the value of output and click the block again. The beep stops? Right! 
35 www.sunfounder.com
Passive Buzzer
Step 1: Build the circuit
T-Cobbler Passive Buzzer Module
GPIO17 SIG
5V0 VCC
GND GND
Step 2: Drag it
You can provide the passive buzzer different frequencies to make it beep different sounds, thus
making multiple scales. In the module there's a block for the setup of the buzzer.
1．In , click and drag and blocks
into the scripting area. 
36 www.sunfounder.com
2．Enter values for the two blocks.
These two blocks can control the passive buzzer, though a little different in results.
The block includes a frequency parameter, so you can change its value
to make the buzzer give out sounds of more scales. The ON and OFF, together with the delay
module in last lesson, can control the lasting time of each note.
The block includes an octave parameter, with CDEFGABC# on the list for
choice. You can use the scales directly with no need to check the mapping table between scale
and frequency. And the time behind will let you save the operation of switching off the buzzer.
This block is like simplifying the application of the module and makes it easier to play some
music.
3．Now use the block to make a melody.
Since the piece of music is a little long, here 4 self-defined blocks are used to make 4 bars of the
entire piece and then combine them. About how to self-define a block, please return to Lesson
5. See the below block for 1st bar:
37 www.sunfounder.com
4．Combine the 4 blocks completed and click to play.

Lesson 12 Photo-interrupter
WHAT IS IT
A photo-interrupter (as shown below) is a sensor with a light-emitting component and lightreceiving component packaged and placed on face-to-face. It applies the principle that light is
interrupted when an object passes through the sensor. Therefore, photo-interrupters are widely used
in speed measurement.

WHAT WE WANT TO DO
There are two pins on the PCF8591 module. After they are connected, the potentiometer will input
directly to AIN0. In this lesson, we'll use it to input analog values. The AIN0 (Analog Input 0) port is
used to receive analog signals from the potentiometer module, and AOUT (Analog Output) is used
to output analog signals to the dual-color LED module so as to change the luminance of the LED.

2．Then you can use the variable adc_val as a block. Use to store the data returned by
the block to the newly-created variable.
Drag into the scripting area, select adc_val on the triangle drop-down list.
3．Click the Module category, click the block of adc collection into the second slot of .
Click the block to run for once. Then the data collected by the adc pcf8591 will be written into
the variable adc_val and stored. At the top right corner of stage, you can see the stored adc_val
and data returned by the adc block.
You can add a forever block for this set block, so the program will keep the setting for the variable
forever. Then when you adjust the potentiometer, the data on stage will change in real time.

Lesson 17 Hall Sensor
WHAT IS IT
Based on Hall Effect, a Hall sensor is a one that varies its output voltage in response to a magnetic
field. Hall sensors are used for proximity switching, positioning, speed detection, and current sensing
applications.
Hall sensors can be categorized into linear (analog) Hall sensors and switch Hall sensors. It includes
amplifier, Schmitt trigger, and output terminal and it outputs digital values. A linear Hall sensor
consists of Hall element, linear amplifier, and emitter follower and it outputs analog values. If you add
a comparator to a linear (analog) Hall sensor it will be able to output both analog and digital signals.

field and unveil the results with a Dual-color LED module.
HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO
Hall sensor
A Hall sensor is a kind of magnetic field sensor based on it.
Electricity carried through a conductor will produce a magnetic field that varies with current, and a
Hall sensor can be used to measure the current without interrupting the circuit. Typically, the sensor
is integrated with a wound core or permanent magnet that surrounds the conductor to be measured.
For switch Hall sensor, take the following steps

The Analog Hall Switch sensor works just like the potentiometer in Lesson 16, reading the value
returned.
Then you can set a threshold based on that value. The values next to the threshold indicate the results
of magnet field detection, by red and green marks.
Put the magnet close to the analog Hall sensor, with the north magnetic pole towards the sensor,
and then "Magnet: North." will be displayed. Move the magnet away, and "Magnet: None." will be
printed. If the magnet approaches the sensor with the south magnetic pole towards it, "Magnet:
South." will be printed on the screen.
Note: Pin D0 of the Analog Hall Sensor will output "0" only when the south pole of the magnet
approaches it, otherwise it will output "1".

Lesson 18 Temperature Sensor
WHAT IS IT
A temperature sensor is a component that senses temperature and converts it into output signals.
By material and component features, temperature sensors can be divided into two types: thermal
resistor and thermocouple. Thermistor is one kind of the former type. It is made of semiconductor
materials; most thermistors are negative temperature coefficient (NTC) ones, the resistance of which
decreases with rising temperature. Since their resistance changes acutely with temperature changes,
thermistors are the most sensitive temperature sensors.
There are two kinds of thermistor module in this kit (as shown below).

Analog temperature sensor Thermistor

WHAT WE WANT TO DO
After learning experiments about rain, light, etc., let's move on to a sensor about temperature -
detect by a temperature sensor.
HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO
This module is based on the principle of the thermistor, whose resistance varies significantly with
ambient temperature. When the ambient temperature increases, the resistance of the thermistor
decreases; when decreases, it increases. It can detect surrounding temperature changes in a realtime manner.

WHAT WE WANT TO DO
Next, let's move on to sound - use a sound sensor to detect the sound in the ambient environment.
HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO
The microphone transforms sound signals into electrical signals and then sends out the signals to
pin 2 of LM358 and outputs them to pin 1 (that's, pin SIG of the module) via the external circuit. Then
use PCF8591 to read analog values.

- Several Jumper wires (Male to Female)
WHAT WE WANT TO DO
In this lesson, we'll use a photoresistor to detect the light intensity around.
HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO
With light intensity increasing, the resistance of a photoresistor will decrease. Thus the output
voltage changes. Analog signals collected by the photoresistor are converted to digital signals
through PCF8591. Then these digital signals are transmitted to Dragiti and printed on the screen.

A flame sensor (as shown below) performs detection by capturing infrared rays with specific
wavelengths from flame. It can be used to detect and warn of flames.

WHAT WE WANT TO DO
Let's play the role of firefighter! But start by using a flame sensor to detect flames first.
HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO
There are several types of flame sensors. In this experiment, we will use a far-infrared flame sensor. It
can detect infrared rays with wavelength ranging from 700nm to 1000nm. A far-infrared flame probe
converts the strength changes of external infrared light into current changes. And then it converts
analog quantities into digital ones. In this experiment, connect pin D0 of the Flame Sensor module
to a GPIO of Raspberry Pi to detect by programming whether any flame exists.

Lesson 22 Gas Sensor
WHAT IS IT
Gas Sensor MQ-2 is a sensor for flammable gas and smoke by detecting the concentration of
combustible gas in the air. They are used in gas detecting equipment for smoke and flammable
gasses in household, industry or automobile.
WHAT IS IT
- 1 * Raspberry Pi
- 1 * Breadboard
- 4 * Jumper wires (Male to Male, 2 red and 2 black)
- 1 * Network cable (or USB wireless network adapter)
- 1 * Active Buzzer module

- 1 * 3-Pin anti-reverse cable
- 1 * 4-Pin anti-reverse cable
- Several Jumper wires (Male to Female)
WHAT WE NEED
Well, to protect us and our stuff from burning, be cautious of smoke is necessary. So in this lesson,
let's check how to make a smog alert with the gas sensor.
HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO
MQ-2 gas sensor is a kind of surface ion type and N-type semiconductors, which uses tin oxide
semiconductor gas sensitive material. When ambient temperature is in 200 ~ 300℃, tin oxide will
adsorb oxygen in the air and form oxygen anion adsorption to decrease electron density in
semiconductor so as to increase its resistance. When in contact with the smoke, if grain boundary
barrier is modulated by the smoke and changed, it could cause surface conductivity change. So you
can gain the information of the smoke existence, The higher the smoke concentration is, the more
conductive the material becomes, thus the lower the output resistance is.
In this experiment, if harmful gases reach a certain concentration, the buzzer will beep to warn.

Place a lighter close to the MQ-2 gas sensor, and press the switch to release gasses. A value between
0 and 255 will be displayed on the screen. If harmful gases reach a certain concentration, the buzzer
will beep, and “Danger Gas!” will be printed on the screen.
You can also turn the shaft of the potentiometer on the module to raise or reduce the concentration
threshold.
Note: The MQ-2 gas sensor needs to be heated up for a while. Wait until the value printed on screen
stays steady and the sensor gets warm, which means it can work normally and sensitively at that time.
It is normal that the gas sensor generates heat. Actually, the higher the temperature is, the more
sensitive the sensor gets.

Lesson 23 IR Remote Control
WHAT IS IT
Each button of an IR remote control (as shown below) has a string of specific encoding. When a
button is pressed, the IR transmitter in the remote control will send out the corresponding IR
encoding signals. On the other side, when the IR receiver receives certain encoding signals, it will
decode them to identify which button is pressed.
What we WHAT WE NEED
- 1 * Raspberry Pi
- 1 * Breadboard
- 4 * Jumper wires (Male to Male)
- 1 * Network cable (or USB wireless network adapter)
- 1 * IR Receiver
- 1 * RGB LED module
- 1 * IR Remote Control
- 1 * 3-Pin anti-reverse cable
- 1 * 4-Pin anti-reverse cable
What we want to do
In this lesson we'll control the RGB LED with a different way - remote control.
How we do that
In this experiment use 9 buttons on the top of the remote to control the color of the RGB LED module.
Each row represents one color, and each column represents the brightness.
OFF Dark Bright
Red
Green
Blue
79 www.sunfounder.com
Step 1: Build the circuit
Note: In Dragit we've already set the GPIO26 as the channel for IR communication. So the pin SIG of
the IR Receiver can only connect to GPIO26; otherwise, the IR Receiver can't communicate well.
Step 2: Drag it
1. First self-define some blocks for color to be used.
For example, the OFF block is to set the color of the RGB to black, so you'll see it's "off".

80 www.sunfounder.com
Set more blocks for other colors.
Color correction by I/O:
Based on the color combination and RGB working principles, we can use the I/O block in the
Raspberry Pi category to control, to set the color as we want. This method is great since the setting
can be more accurate and controllable. But it also has weakness - you need to set the output value
of each pin. It's a PWM value and cannot be set based on the color parameter of the RGB.
As shown above, you can use three I/O output blocks for an RGB LED block. 
81 www.sunfounder.com
After the self-customed block for RGB color is done, let's move on to the IR control part.
2. Drag the blocks for IR control.
First, make this chunk block to test the remote.
After clicking it to run, orient the remote at the receiver, and press any key. Then the key should
be printed on stage.
Try to press all the keys to be used and see whether they can all be shown on stage for the test. In
case of error, for a complex experiment, you'd better test for each step for guarantee. After
confirming the key works well, click the red button at the top right corner to stop. Then move on
to next steps.
If "None" is printed all the time, there may be several possible reasons: 1) The remote is not
oriented at the receiver, or the battery runs out energy; 2) Pin sig of the receiver is not connected
to GPIO26, or the wire is loose on the breadboard; 3) Configuration of Dragit is incorrect. Well, for
the first 2 issues, simply tackle them; but for the third, you need to refer to the beginning of this
instruction documentation and repeat the Installation steps - the configuration will be carried
during the course. 
82 www.sunfounder.com
If the problem is still unsolved, please post on our forum or email service@sunfounder.com.
So now the remote control works normally. Let's make the whole program.
After clicking it to run, orient the remote at the receiver, and press keys onside. Based on the key
setting, the RGB LED should light up different colors when you press different keys.
Each of the top three rows of buttons on the remote control represents a kind of color, i.e. red, green,
and blue, top to bottom. Each column represents off, light, and dark. For example, press the second
button (light) on the first row (red), and the LED will flash light red. You can use the remote to generate 
83 www.sunfounder.com
27 colors in total (including all the LEDs off). Try to change the color of the RGB LED with the 9 buttons!

print the result on the screen.
This sensor works by sending a sound wave out and calculating the time it takes for the sound wave
to get back to the ultrasonic sensor. By doing this, it can tell us how far away objects are relative to
the ultrasonic sensor.

invalid. The method of throwing away null data and adopting only valid data is what's called "filter".
Now you can see the distance between the ultrasonic ranging module and the obstacle (like your
palm) in front on stage. Sway your hand over the ultrasonic ranging module slowly and observe the

with a microprocessor. It supports multi-point networking to measure multi-point temperatures.
Eight sensors can be connected at most, because it will consume too much power supply and cause
low voltage thus harming the stability of transmission.
When using the DS18B20, you need to connect a 10KΩ resistor to the middle pin DQ to pull up the
level.
Step 1：Build the circuit according to the following method
Note: In Dragit, the W1 main line has already been set to
GPIO4, so please connect pin SIG of the DS18b20 sensor to
GPIO4; otherwise, the block cannot acquire the return
value.

Numbering of DS18B20: If multiple DS18B20 modules are
connected in the circuit, they will be numbered separately. If only
one connects, it’s numbered 0.
Now, you can see the current temperature value displayed on the
screen.

Lesson 27 Rotary Encoder Module
WHAT IS IT
A rotary encoder is an electro-mechanical device that converts the angular position or motion of a
shaft or axle to analog or digital code. Rotary encoders are usually placed at the side which is
perpendicular to the shaft. They act as sensors for detecting angle, speed, length, position, and
acceleration in automation field.
WHAT WE NEED
- 1 * Raspberry Pi
- 1 * Breadboard
- 4 * Jumper wires (Male to Male, 2 red and 2 black)
- 1 * Network cable (or USB wireless network adapter)
- 1 * Rotary Encoder module
- 1 * 5-Pin anti-reverse cable
WHAT WE WANT TO DO
Control the clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) rotation of sprite by rotary encoder and
record the times of rotation.
When you spin the knob of the rotary encoder, pin CLK and DT output high or low levels. Based this
output, you can tell whether the encoder's direction is CW or CCW. Press the knob, pin SW will output
a High or Low level too, which can be used as a button.

Lesson 28 Humiture Sensor
WHAT IS IT
The digital temperature and humidity sensor DHT11 is a composite sensor that contains a calibrated
digital signal output of temperature and humidity. The technology of a dedicated digital modules
collection and the temperature and humidity sensing technology are applied to ensure that the
product has high reliability and excellent long-term stability.
The sensor includes a resistive sense of wet component and an NTC temperature measurement
device, and is connected with a high-performance 8-bit microcontroller.
WHAT WE NEED
- 1 * Raspberry Pi
- 1 * Breadboard
- 4 * Jumper wires (Male to Male, 2 red and 2 black)
- 1 * Network cable (or USB wireless network adapter)
- 1 * Humiture module
- 1 * 3-Pin anti-reverse cable
WHAT WE WANT TO DO
Apart from reading temperature as we've done before, in this lesson, we'll read more - humidity,
making it a humiture detection experiment.
HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO
The communication process begins with the DATA line sending start signal to DHT11, and DHT11
receives the signal and returns an answer signal, then the host receives the answer signal and begins
to receive 40-bit humiture data (8-bit humidity integer + 8-bit humidity decimal + 8-bit temperature
integer + 8-bit temperature decimal + 8-bit checksum). For more information, please refer to the
datasheet of DHT11.
Step 1: Build the circuit

96 www.sunfounder.com
Step 2: Drag it
For
the
Dht11 block, you can set it
to return a temperature (in Celsius or Kelvin) or humidity value.
If ERR_CRC is returned, it's because the data received is incorrect. But if ERR_MISSING_DATA appears,
it's because the data received is missing. Once it happens, you may check whether it's the line
interference or loose connection. Don't worry - wait and see the next data which should be good
then.

Lesson 29 IR Obstacle Avoidance Module
WHAT IS IT
An IR obstacle avoidance module (as shown below) uses infrared reflection principle to detect
obstacles. When there is no object ahead, infrared-receiver cannot receive signals; when there is an
object ahead, it will block and reflect infrared light, then infrared-receiver can receive signals.
WHAT WE NEED
- 1 * Raspberry Pi
- 1 * Breadboard
- 4 * Jumper wires (Male to Male, 2 red and 2 black)
- 1 * Network cable (or USB wireless network adapter)
- 1 * IR Obstacle module
- 1 * 3-Pin anti-reverse cable
WHAT WE WANT TO DO
Detect obstacles by the IR sensor on this module.
HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO
An obstacle avoidance sensor mainly consists of an infrared-transmitter, an infrared-receiver and a
potentiometer. According to the reflecting feature of an object, if there is no obstacle, emitted
infrared ray will weaken with the propagation distance and finally disappear. If there is an obstacle,
when infrared ray encounters an obstacle, it will be reflected back to the infrared-receiver. Then the
infrared-receiver detects this signal and confirms an obstacle exists ahead.
Note: The detection distance of the infrared sensor is adjustable - you may adjust it by the
potentiometer.

Lesson 31 Barometer BMP280
WHAT IS IT
The BMP280 is an absolute barometric pressure sensor especially designed for mobile applications.
The sensor module is housed in an extremely compact 8-pin metal-lid LGA package with a footprint
of only 2.0x2.5mm2
and 0.95mm package height. Its small dimensions and low power consumption
of 2.7µA@1Hz allow the implementation in battery-driven devices such as mobile phones, GPS
modules or watches. It supports two types of communication: I2C and SPI.
WHAT WE NEED
- 1 * Raspberry Pi
- 1* Power Adapter for Raspberry Pi
- 1 * SunFounder T Extension+40-pin Ribbon Cable for T-Cobbler
- 1 * BMP280 Module
- Several Jump Wires
- 1 * Breadboard
WHAT WE WANT TO DO
Detect the air pressure with the barometer module.
HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO
First, get to know the pins on the module.
Power
 VCC: power pin. The working voltage for the chip is 1.71-3.6V. Since the module integrates a 3.3V
voltage regulator, the power supply can be either 3.3V or 5V. If you are using an Arduino board, you're
recommended to use a 5V power supply.
 3.3V: the output of the voltage regulator, meaning you can provide the chip with a 3.3V for power
here.
 GND: common ground for power and logic
BMP280 supports I2C and SPI communication and the module keeps both ports. If you want to make
the circuit simple, you can use the I2C port; to connect multiple sensors, you can use the SPI port free
of I2C address collisions.
- I2C interface
The I2C interface uses the following pins:
 SCK: serial clock (SCL)
 SDI: data (SDA)
 SDO: The I2C address decides the pin. If SDO connects to GND (0), the address is 0x76, if it connects
to VDDIO (1), the address is 0x77. In this module, we have connected it to VDDIO, so the address 
104 www.sunfounder.com
should be 0x77.
 CSB: Must be connected to VDDIO to select I2C interface.
- SPI interface
The SPI interface uses the following pins:
 CSB: chip select, active low and has an integrated pull-up resistor
 SCK: serial clock
 SDI: serial data input; data input/output in 3-wire mode
 SDO: serial data output; hi-Z in 3-wire mode
Experimental Procedures
I2C will be used as communication interface in the following experiment.

Lesson 33 RTC DS1302
WHAT IS IT
DS1302 is a trickle charging clock chip, launched by DALLAS in America. With a built-in real-time
clock/calendar and a 31-byte static RAM, it can communicate with MCU through simple serial
interfaces. The real-time clock/calendar circuit provides information about second, minute, hour, day,
month, and year. DS1302 can automatically adjust the number of days per month and days in leap
year. You can determine to use a 24-hour or 12-hour system by AM/PM selection.
WHAT WE NEED

- 1 * 5-Pin anti-reverse cable
WHAT WE WANT TO DO
Set the time with the RTC module and read the time stored on the RTC.
Interfacing the DS1302 with a microprocessor is simplified by using synchronous serial
communication. Only three wires are required to communicate with the clock/RAM: RST, serial data
(SDA) and serial clock (SCL). SDA can be transferred to and from the clock/RAM one byte at a time or
in a burst of up to 31 bytes.
HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO
Step 1: Build the circuit
Note: In Dragit, GPIO23, GPIO24 and GPIO25 have already been set as channels for RTC, so connect

Lesson 34 Tracking Sensor
WHAT IS IT
The infrared tracking sensor uses a TRT5000 sensor. The blue LED of TRT5000 is the emission tube
and after electrified it emits infrared light invisible to human eye. The black part of the sensor is for
receiving; the resistance of the resistor inside changes with the infrared light
received.

WHAT WE WANT TO DO
Detect black lines on a white surface with the Tracking Sensor.
When the infrared transmitter emits rays to a piece of paper, if the rays shine on a white surface, they
will be reflected and received by the receiver, and pin SIG will output low level; If the rays encounter
black lines, they will be absorbed, thus the receiver gets nothing, and pin SIG will output high level.
